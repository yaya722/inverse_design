# Project Overview

Welcome to this GitHub repository, which contains three Python scripts focused on deep learning and data processing tasks. Below, you can find a brief description of each script, including its purpose and usage.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `fcnn.py`
This script implements a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). The model is designed for classification or regression tasks. It is built using PyTorch, leveraging its powerful library for defining and training deep learning models.

- **Key Features**:
  - Fully connected layers for flexible model definition.
  - Customizable architecture parameters.
  - Easy to train and adapt to different datasets.

### 2. `pnn_reverse.py`
This script contains an implementation related to the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with a unique reverse mechanism. The PNN approach is used for pattern recognition problems and can handle complex classification tasks effectively.

- **Key Features**:
  - Reverse functionality for enhanced prediction performance.
  - Focuses on probabilistic approaches for decision-making.
  - Modular structure for easy modification and experimentation.

### 3. `整合mat文件.py`
This script processes `.mat` files, commonly used in MATLAB, to integrate them for further data analysis or use in deep learning workflows. It helps in consolidating data for training or other purposes, making the workflow seamless for deep learning experiments.

- **Key Features**:
  - Integration of multiple `.mat` files for data preparation.
  - Prepares data in a suitable format for machine learning models.
  - Simplifies the transition from MATLAB to Python environments.

## Usage

Each script can be run individually after configuring the necessary environment. Please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Scipy (for `.mat` file processing)

To install these dependencies, you can use:

```bash
pip install torch scipy
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the scripts as follows:

```bash
python fcnn.py
```

or

```bash
python 整合mat文件.py
```
